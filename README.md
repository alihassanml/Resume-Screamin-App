## Resume Screaming App with Machine Learning using Django

**Project Description:**
The Resume Screaming App aims to enhance the process of resume screening by leveraging machine learning techniques. This Django-based web application utilizes a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier implemented with the scikit-learn library. By analyzing the content of resumes, the app can provide insights into the suitability of candidates for specific job roles.

**Libraries Used:**

1. **pandas**: Pandas is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library in Python. It provides easy-to-use data structures and functions for working with structured data.

2. **numpy**: NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.

3. **seaborn**: Seaborn is a statistical data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

4. **matplotlib**: Matplotlib is a plotting library for Python that produces publication-quality figures in a variety of formats. It can be used for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.

5. **scikit-learn**: Scikit-learn is a machine learning library in Python that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis. It features various algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and more.

**Project Structure:**

- **data**: This directory contains the dataset used for training the machine learning model.
- **models**: This directory holds the trained machine learning models.
- **templates**: Contains HTML templates for the web pages of the Django application.
- **views.py**: Defines the views (controller logic) for the Django application.
- **urls.py**: Specifies the URL patterns for the Django application.
- **settings.py**: Configuration settings for the Django application.
- **manage.py**: The Django project management script.
